# CSS Positioning Assignment - Institute of Software Engineering

This repository contains a series of design implementations that focus on the use of various CSS positioning techniques, as part of the coursework at the **Institute of Java and Software Engineering**.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project explores different CSS positioning methods such as `absolute`, `relative`, `fixed`, `sticky`, and the `grid layout`. Each design case has been built with specific guidelines and requirements in mind, making use of HTML and CSS to create fixed layouts that don't change upon browser resizing.

### 🔍 Case Studies

#### **Case 1: Full-Screen Layout with Absolute and Relative Positions**
- Utilize the entire screen for design.
- Only absolute and relative positions are used.
- The design remains static regardless of browser resizing.
- No images allowed for this case.

#### **Case 2: Structured Design with Box Model**
- Includes a side navigation bar that automatically resizes based on content.
- Content area remains structured as new elements are added.
- Makes use of absolute, relative, and box-model properties.
- Uses Google Fonts and FontAwesome for enhanced styling.

#### **Case 3: Fixed Position Borders**
- Implements fixed position properties to create borders that remain in the center of the viewport while the content flows inside.
- The full screen is used to build the design.
